# The Cross-Functional Communicator

As a Cross-Functional Communicator, your goal is not to actually learn practical code, but rather to understand it from a theoretical perspective. Essentially, just enough understanding to foster better designer-developer relationships. You may be very early in your career, struggling to understand jargon and aiming to write comprehensive lists of technical specifications. Perhaps you’re a mid-level designer adjusting to a new platform, or a senior-level designer looking to break into a product manager role.
